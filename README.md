## Synopsis

This adventure begins in a small hamlet in the backwater of the kingdom, it's a quiet place... most of the time. Recently, there has been an in influx of goblins in the region and some of the foul creatures have even begun attacking the farms in the outskirts of the village of Villane. The Player Characters are all friends from a nearby village, traveling to Bedegar, in search of adventure. It isn't long before they find themselves mixed up in the business of Goblins, pursuing the daughter of the Blacksmith into the depths of a long forgotten tomb. This is their opportunity to prove themselves, and to rescue someone in need, if they can survive the perils of the Delian Tomb!
