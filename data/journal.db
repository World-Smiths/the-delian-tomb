If your players aren't motivated, simply by their sense of justice and duty, you can have Lars point out that there is a standing bounty for goblin ears by order of the Duke. Now is a good time to remind you, one of your best moves as a Dungeon Master is to simply ask the players, \"What do you do?\" — this is a great opportunity to use that move! Once Lars has convinced the adventurers to help, you can continue on to @JournalEntry[jCb8GVUC0p6tm2Hk]{Part 2}.</p>"},"_id":"yjp6nHtcJVPBlT0f","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Pressure Plate Trap</h2>\n<p>A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice the trap, the faint light of the brazier just barely catching the raised bit of floor. If a character then succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using @Item[Thieves' Tools], they can disable the trap without triggering it. This can also be attempted with any bladed weapon, but the check is made at disadvantage. Additionally, if there are any Small sized Player Characters (Halfings, Gnomes) they won't trigger the trap. Any other creature who steps on the pressure plate will trigger the trap, causing a scythe to sweep down from the ceiling. The character who triggered the trap must succeed a on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer [[/r 1d8]] slashing damage. Once the trap has either been disabled, or triggered it is exhausted and will not be triggered again.</p>"},"_id":"wKfL3FFJSDGPcIcl","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}
