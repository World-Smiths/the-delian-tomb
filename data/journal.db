Until the goblin is either dead, or inside, they will spend their movement retreating and their action firing arrows back at the adventurers. If the goblin patrol survives long enough, you might have him shout a warning to the goblins guarding the entrance of the tomb.

A creature actively searching for another creature will roll a Wisdom (Perception) check against the Dexterity (Stealth) roll of the other creature. If neither side attempts to be stealthy, they notice each other at the same time. A surprised creature cannot take an action or move on their first turn. They cannot take a reaction until after their first turn ends.

If your players aren't motivated, simply by their sense of justice and duty, you can have Lars point out that their is a standing bounty for goblin ears by order of the Duke. Now is a good time to remind you, one of your best moves as a Dungeon Master is to simply ask the players, \"What do you do?\" — this is a great opportunity to use that move!
