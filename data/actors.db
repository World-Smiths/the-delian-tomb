Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling. Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth. Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers. The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin's chaotic politics. All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors. If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin). Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows. Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King. It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves. Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons. WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger. Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair's heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship. They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids. This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins. Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue. We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp's rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat. Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling. Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth. Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers. The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin's chaotic politics. All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors. If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin). Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows. Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King. It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves. Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons. WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger. Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair's heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship. They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids. This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins. Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor. Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Goblinoid","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Underdark","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 166","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":16,"prof":4,"total":6},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"fq5ww5LBGlacDJ85":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Goblin","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Goblin.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1671091494944,"lastModifiedBy":"0SB1YMKt7omYISv2"}}

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world.

This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk. Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor. Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant's tasks with exceeding care. Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them. The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic. The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death. Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives. The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments. With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master's will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge. Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations. The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master. Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives. One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake. Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells. Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author's Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer's journey will be humanoid. Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 272","class":{},"size":"med"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["bludgeoning"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned","exhaustion"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Understands all languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"fq5ww5LBGlacDJ85":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Skeleton","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Skeleton.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1671091495346,"lastModifiedBy":"0SB1YMKt7omYISv2"}}
